This is my offline documentations center.

I often have to work offline.

But I always need to access to  API, framework reference documentations..

Luckily, Most of my documentation website are on Github + most of them are generated with jekyll or nodejs

- So I manage to "download" them with "git clone --depth=1".
- compile them, and run them locally, each website on a different HTTP PORT
